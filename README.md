# AFM-346-Assignments

A repository to store my AFM 346 R Assignments both in Rmd and html.

Assignment 1 is basic graphing and explanations of correlations.

Assignment 2 is where I begin to train models, first starting with linear regression and kNN.

Assignment 3 is where I train kNN and logistic regression models.

Assignment 4 is where start training more complex models such as boosting and random forest.

In Assignment 5, I train SVM and neural networks for the same purpose as in Assignment 4; the models in Assignment 5 are trained to solve the same problem as in Assignment 4.

In my final project for the class, I was to train 3 models - a baseline model, low-complexity model, and high performing model. These models would be compared in their ability to solve the same problem. Long story short, the increased training time was for a marginal payoff.
